        "This project is meant to run as a webhook on GCP Cloud Functions for a Dialogflow integration, but for development purposes I also wanted it to run as a Colab or locally.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, we need to run a few checks and execute/install things depending on the environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "We first check if this code is running in Colab or otherwise (e.g. a Google Cloud Function or locally) and we ask for a location. When it's running as a webhook, the webhook function is called directly, including a JSON-formatted location, skipping the \"main\" function. When it's running in Colab or locally, we execute the main funtion to correctly format the requested location in a way that is compatible with the webhook method, artificially creating a JSON request from the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Getting the location\n",
        "Once we have the JSON request with a location, we determine what the location means by running it by the Google Maps API, which is very robust and can generally generate an address for even the most malformed and unintuitive location requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Getting the Covid statistics\n",
        "With an accurate location in hand, we determine which data to retrieve from Johns Hopkins CSSE on Github, since there are options for US States or US counties and international data. This is updated daily, so we always have recent data to work with. We filter out unneeded data and, since the data includes latitudes and longitudes, we find the distance from the requested location and sort the data by that distance. Sometimes, the JH locations don't match up with Google's locations, so we then check that the address components match, so we're getting the most relevant location instead of just the nearest location. We now have the most relevant data!\n",
        "\n",
        "## Returning results\n",
        "With the best data now defined, we simply format the output as desired. Primarily, this means returning the data to Dialogflow so that the Google Assistant knows how to use it, but for other API calls and running the code directly, we output data in a more readable format."
